 # IP2Location Toolkit

The IP2Location Toolkit is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to download and select IP2Location databases. IP2Location databases provide information about IP addresses, such as their location, ISP, and other details.

## Installation

To install the IP2Location Toolkit, you will need to have Python 3 or later installed. You can then install the toolkit using the following command:

```
pip install ip2location-toolkit
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the IP2Location Toolkit, you can use it by running the following command:

```

This will open the toolkit's main menu, which provides you with the following options:
